# BubbleSort in JS

---

## About

My class mates and I have discovered various ways to implement Bubblesort in JS.
We want to know what the fastest method would be in a real world situation.

## What I've done

I have created a collection of fake data and will be running a series of benchmarking and unit tests in order to determine which of these is the best method.

## Methods

I will be using Jest

## Results

Results will be displayed in `/results/log.txt`.
